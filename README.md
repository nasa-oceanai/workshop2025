### Day Two: Forge Your Weapons (Tuesday, May 20th)

On the second day of your quest, your battalion will harness the wisdom of the realm’s scholars and forge the tools needed to conquer your challenge. You’ll craft a prototype and test your mettle against the ocean’s mysteries, preparing for the final battle on Day Three.

- **Morning – Gather at the War Table (9:00 AM – 10:00 AM)**: Begin by reflecting on your quest and gathering insights from the day’s scrolls of wisdom. Your **Sage of the Tides** and **Sorcerer of Algorithms** will:
  - Recap Day One’s progress
  - Lay out the day’s battle plan
- **Afternoon – Forge and Test Your Arsenal (2-Hour Hackathon)**: craft and test your prototype. Each knight has a role to play:
  - **Sage of the Tides**: Lead the documentation of the physical context in the shared notes. Answer team questions about physical constraints.
  - **Sorcerer of Algorithms**: Lead the coding of the ML model, starting with a simple prototype. 
  - **Lifeguard**: Assist with data access (e.g., pulling data from S3), answering questions about jupyterhub. 
  - **Bard of Chronicles**: Document the hackathon process in the shared notes, capturing challenges (e.g., data quality issues), decisions (e.g., feature selection rationale), and early results (e.g., model performance metrics). 
  - **Watcher of the Waves**: If you have ML background, test the prototype on a small data subset, providing feedback on initial outputs (e.g., prediction accuracy, visualizations). If you have oceanography background, create some visulizations of the ocean features in the dataset. Save them in the shared document. 

- **Deliverable**: A working ML prototype that processes a data subset and produces initial results (e.g., predictions, a simple visualization like a graph of predicted vs. actual values).
- **Goal**: By the end of the hackathon, your battalion should have a functional prototype tested on a subset of the data, with a clear plan for refinement on Day Three, or the night of Day Two.

#### Points to Earn on Day Two
Earn points for your battalion by completing the following tasks during the day:

- **Earn 1 point** for creating and testing a functional prototype

- **Earn 1 point** for committing your prototype code and notes to the GitHub repository
- **Earn 1 point** for sketching a draft outline for the final presentation (e.g., slide titles: "Problem," "Approach," "Results").

**Total Possible Points: 4** – These points ensure your battalion is well-prepared for the final day of the quest.


Let’s refine the Day Three plan for the NASA Ocean AI Workshop 2025 Hackathon, occurring on Wednesday, May 21st, 2025, as part of the "Quest for the Ocean Code." Today is Sunday, May 18, 2025, at 11:07 PM PDT, so the event is just days away. The current Day Three plan focuses on reflecting, refining the prototype, presenting results, and documenting lessons learned. I’ll improve this section by aligning it with the previously established agenda (which includes talks, discussions, and a panel), enhancing the medieval knight theme, clarifying tasks and deliverables (e.g., what "polish the document presentation" means), and defining a 3-point system for consistency with Days One and Two. I’ll also ensure the timing aligns with the agenda and integrate roles for each activity.

### Analysis of Current Plan:
- **Strengths**:
  - Thematic elements like "Charge into Battle," "Gather at the War Table," and "Siege to the High Ground" align with the knightly narrative.
  - Clear focus on reflecting, refining, presenting, and documenting.
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - **Timing Misalignment**: The agenda lists talks (9:00 AM – 10:30 AM), a group discussion (10:30 AM – 12:00 PM), lunch (12:00 PM – 12:30 PM), hack time (12:30 PM – 2:00 PM), presentations (2:00 PM – 2:30 PM), a panel (2:30 PM – 3:30 PM), discussion (3:30 PM – 4:00 PM), and conclusion (4:00 PM). The current plan’s "Gather at the War Table (10:30 AM – 12:00 PM)" aligns with the discussion, but "Siege to the High Ground (1:00 PM – 2:00 PM)" and "Claim Victory (3:30 PM – 4:00 PM)" don’t fully match the hackathon (12:30 PM – 2:00 PM) and presentation (2:00 PM – 2:30 PM) slots, and they miss the panel/discussion.
  - **Clarity and Deliverables**: "Polish the document presentation" and "articulate a recommendation on the dataset, next step" are vague. I’ll specify deliverables (e.g., a 2-slide presentation, a recommendation section in the shared notes).
  - **Point System**: Missing a structured point system (Days One and Two award 3 points each). I’ll define 3 achievable points.
  - **Role-Specific Tasks**: Roles (e.g., Sage of the Tides, Bard of Chronicles) aren’t mentioned. I’ll integrate them to ensure all team members contribute.
  - **Thematic Enhancement**: "Siege to the High Ground" is thematic but doesn’t fully convey the collaborative refinement process. I’ll adjust for clarity and immersion.
  - **Goal Refinement**: "Document the activities, results, and lessons learned" is good, but "articulate a recommendation on the dataset, next step" can be better integrated into deliverables and discussions.

### Refined Day Three Plan:
I’ll align the timing with the agenda, define a 3-point system, specify deliverables, enhance the thematic language, and integrate roles and the agenda’s activities.


### Day Three: Charge into Battle (Wednesday, May 21st)

On the final day of your quest, your battalion will conquer the battleground and celebrate your triumphs. You’ll refine your prototype, present your victories to the council of knights.

Add a recommendation section from **Lifeguard** to the shared notes on dataset improvements and next steps
  - **Watcher of the Waves**: Providing feedback on final outputs, and assist the Bard with presentation visuals (e.g., a key graph or map).
  - **Deliverable**: A 3-slide presentation (e.g., in Google Slides or a shared doc) and a finalized prototype with at least one polished visualization.
  
- **Afternoon – The Final Council (2:00 PM – 2:30 PM)**: Present your triumphs.
  - Each battalion delivers a 3–5 minute presentation to the council of knights (all participants and organizers). The **Bard of Chronicles** leads, with the **Sage of the Tides** and **Sorcerer of Algorithms** explaining the physics and ML solution. The **Lifeguard** and **Watcher of the Waves** chime in when needed.
  - **Final Council (2:30 PM – 4:00 PM)**: Join the panel and group discussions, sharing your quest’s lessons (e.g., dataset challenges, ML insights) and contributing to the realm’s future.
